			<h1>About the Site</h1>
			<p>
				 This site shows to all interested, either students or professionals, that is possible and easy to create a Tableless site, accessible and compatible with the <a href="http://www.w3c.org/" title="World Wide Web Consortium" target="_blank">W3C</a> specifications.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having this on mind, we created some tableless examples of big business sites.
We must be clear that we aren't cloning or copying this sites here. We're just showing how they would be if made under webstandards.

			<h1>What is tableless?</h1>
			<p>Tableless is nothing but: A method to building sites without tables, using <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" target="_blank" title="CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) - Learn More in W3C.">CSS</a>, <a href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/xhtml1/" target="_blank" title="XHTML - Visit W3C to learn more.">XHTML</a> (or another <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/" target="_blank" title="HTML - Visit W3C to learn more.">HTML</a> Version),
 making the sites under the <a href="http://www.w3c.org/">W3C</a> specifications. In a tableless page you will use <a href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/xhtml1/" target="_blank" title="XHTML - Visit W3C to learn more.">XHTML</a> (highly recommendable) or other HTML Version to the content, leaving the document formatting in a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" target="_blank" title="CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) - Visit W3C to learn more.">CSS</a> file (Cascading Style Sheets), thus separating <a href="http://www.tableless.com.br/infoform.asp" title="Portuguese - Artigo sobre a separação da informação e da formatação">information and layout</a>, bringing a lot of advantages to site, developers and clients. </p>

			<h1>3 reasons to make tableless sites:</h1>
			<p> There are several reasons to make a tableless site, but here are
           barely 3 basics motives.
			<br />
			<ol>
				<li><b>Accessibility:</b><br />
				  If you are using text browsers or another
           device to visit a site whose layout was done using tables,
           you will have some difficulty on visualizing it. W3C
           recommends not to use tables for layouts of sites. 
           But, if the user accesses a tableless site that uses CSS for
           formatting, he will be able to visit the sites on
           cellphones, WebTV's, PalmTops, etc.   </li><br /><br />

				<li><b>Efficiency: </b><br />
				Adopting the tableless approach, you, codewriter
				of the site, will have a incredible facility
           on making the site up to date; not the content alone,
           but also the formatation. In tableless sites  the
           INFORMATION is separated from the FORMATATION, consequently
           if you need to modify the content or the visual,
           the seeking code time will be reduced. </li><br /><br />

				<li><b>Semantic:</b><br />
				When you separate the FORMATATION from INFORMATION and organize your code,
	you don't use the FONT, CENTER, and other deprecated tags.<br />
	Example: A lot of people use to define the Page Title like this :<br /><br />
				&lt;font size="5" face="Verdana"&gt;Title&lt;/font&gt; <br /><br />
				Wouldn't it be better this way:<br /><br />
				&lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;<br /><br /> Making this, your code will be more semantic: an interpreter, a search engine, or a screen reader will know that this is a Title.
				</li>
			</ol>
