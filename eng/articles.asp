		<h1>Simplicity</h1>
		<p>
			Anyone who knows HTML, or even use a WYSIWYG editor, had a problem with it. If you work with Internet, you certainly had this problem. The code becomes complex, with a lot of table, one inside the other. A lot of frames, with a huge script code to keep the content updated, one part of the application in a pop-up system with a script that update the main content. <a href="http://www.tableless.com.br/eng/simplicity.asp" title="Read: Simplicity"><img src="imagens/lerartigo.gif" title="Read: Simplicity" alt="Read: Simplicity" /></a><br />

		<h1>Why use valid XHTML?</h1>
		<p>
			I believe you all have heard about Semantics. For those who haven't,
in a few words: A project to organize and struturize information
that's on the web. <a href="http://www.tableless.com.br/eng/xhtml.asp" title="Read: Why use valid XHTML?"><img src="imagens/lerartigo.gif" title="Read: Why use valid XHTML?" alt="Read: Why use valid XHTML?" /></a><br />
